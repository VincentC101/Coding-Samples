# Coding-Samples
Coding sample for the Research Assistant Position

Hw5.ipynb features a coding sample from a machine learning course. This works with an image and running singular value decomposition on the matrices for red green and blue color channels, compressing the image to various extents.

words_for_clusters is from my work with Charactour in which I worked on preprocessing movie and tv scripts, feeding said data to ML algorithms, and running TF/IDF on said scripts to find the most common words. I also attained personality information in the form of personality clusters that another group worked to find, along with the movie and tv titles that said clusters liked. I used this data to determine which words would appeal best to differing personality clusters based on the frequency of words in the media they enjoyed most. I cannot pass along the actual data that I worked with unfortunately but I hope this will suffice.
